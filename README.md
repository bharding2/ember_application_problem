# ember-application-problem

I started as a code challenge for a job application and now have turned into a reason to mess with ember instead.  What a weird world.  The goal is to take a github repo url and return issue information.

The rest of this stuff is crazy ember stuff, who knew they populated readme data as well.

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.
